	 1. Class: 
	  curly brace represent that method is implemented, in a class method is implemented, method can NOT be declared
	  - a class can extend ONLY one class or abstract class
	  - a class can implement more than one interface
	  - when a class extends an abstract class or a regular class and implements more than one interface then it is called 'Concrete Class' 
	  - a class can be instantiated*
	 2. Interface:
	  curly brace absent means that method is declared, in an interface, method can NOT be implemented, ONLY declared
	  by default, methods in interface are Abstract so need to write 'abstract'
	  - an interface can extend more than one interface class
	  - an interface can NOT implements class, abstract class, interface
	  - *an interface can NOT be instantiated (can NOT create object) because of complete lack of implementation of method
	 3. Abstract Class:
	  abstract class can contain abstract (declared) and non abstract methods (implemented method)
	 - an abstract class can extend ONLY one class or abstract class
	 - an abstract class can implement more than one interface
	 - when an abstract class extends an abstract class or a regular class and implements more than one interface then it is called 'Concrete Class 
	 - *an abstract class can NOT be instantiated (can NOT create object) because of partial lack of implementation of method
	 
	 - University (Gym, cafeteria, library), college, high school, middle school, elementary school - interface
	 Put static and default methods in University.
		- HunterCollege, MolloyCollege, MonroeCollege - Abstract Class
		- NewYorkUniversity, RockefellerUniversity - Regular Class
	 Use keyword 'extends' in interface, abstract class and class
	 Use keyword 'implements' in abstract class and class
	 Create a test class and call all the methods
