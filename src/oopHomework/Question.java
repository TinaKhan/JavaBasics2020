	 The code need to prepare according to the question:

Phone is an interface which has four abstract method interfaceInfo, call, message and camera. It has 2 other method - battery and wireless which are implemented, from them - print out what type of method they are. [one of the example -- "battery is a ...... method from Java ....."].
When you get a chance to implement interfaceInfo, print out the following: [What are the features of Interface you know? Can we create constructor inside an interface? Can we write variable inside Interface? Don't copy paste, write how much you can remember]

Do you think we can extends or implements Interface? Single or multiple? Create two interface Pager and Wireless and One class name LandPhone. make a relation of them with Phone if possible.

Assume Samsung is an abstract Class wich have 2 method: One is abstractClassInfo [which is a non abstract method, print out all the features of an abstract class compared with Interface and Abstract class.], what type of method would be the other one - name samsungInfo? Think about two interface name AndroidPhone and Tablet. And a regular class name SamsungGalaxy. Can you make a relationship with Samsung, AndroidPhone, Tablet and SamsungGalaxy?

Now think about a regular class Iphone1. Create a method of it named - regularClassInfo and print out all the features of a regular class compared with Interface and Abstract class. what is the relation between regualr class, Abstract class and Interface? Can you make a relation of Iphone1 with Phone Interface and Samsung Abstract class. [Write code after answering code of 1 and 2.]

Think about a class name TestPhone. Instantiate Phone, Samsung and Iphone1 inside it. Call all the possible method by each of them. Go to next step after finishing question 1-4.

Assume 4 private variable name price (as int), Info (as String, write few words when you bought it), grade (as a char, A or B), madeInUSA (as boolean) inside Iphone1 class. If the variables are private how can you use those variavble? What kind of concept you can use? Now print out in TestPhone: "I bought the phone in 2000, the price was 750$, grade is A and boolean value for made in USA is: false".

NOW, Iphone1 came in 2000, but new model Iphone2, Iphone3 came in 2001. Assume Iphone1 is a super class and Iphone2 and Iphone3 is child class of Iphone1. in 2002, Iphone4 come in the market which mostly follow Iphone2 (parent of Iphone 4). in 2003, Iphone5 come in the market which mostly follow Iphone4 (parent of Iphone 5). in 2004, Iphone6 come in the market which mostly follow Iphone5 (parent of Iphone 6). Consider all of them as a class and write a method inside them related to one of the feature like map (use in Iphone3 and print out "Map is introduce in Iphone2. The price is increased to: 780$", here price is int type. When we can use a varaible inside a println directly?), youtube, dropbox, photos etc. What kind of concept you can use? and Instantiate all of them and call all the methods possible. Now, from 5 we got 4 private variable. Create 2 constructor inside Iphone1 class -- default and parameterized after those variables. Use super keyword in Iphone2 and call the parameterized constructor of Iphone1. Also call one of the method by super(). Can you call variable by super key word? create a variable inside Iphone1. What type of variable it would be?

Think about Iphone6. It also has 2 method same name materials(). They are parameterized method (int ram, int camera), another one (int ram, int camera, String Processor). What kind of concept you can use? Can you use final or static method here as same method name? Choose parameter by yourself. Instantiate the class in TestPhone and initialize thos emethods. Now think about a class Name ConfiguredIphone6 which extends Iphone6. Override those method and change the logic at your own to show the changes. Show the output in TestPhone.

Comment out at the end of TestPhone to inform me which is hierarchical inheritance, multilevel inheritance and single inheritance
